			<h1>General Overview</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>The information here is based on the two datasets: the one about the medals won by countries
in the London 2012 Olympiad and WHO statistics for multitude of countries. The first dataset is complete and clean, however the 
second one is quite inconsistent. In order to provide you this solution, we had to merge those two datasets, and we have eliminated
mostly empty columns and rows. The remaining missing values were filled with zeroes and interpreted as noise.</p>
				<p>There are 173 countries in the remaining data set, featuring 258 dimensions, 4 of which are describing medal count.</p>

			<h1>Trends</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>We have found that big countries do not necessarily win lots of medals, but wealthy countries do. 
Unsurprisingly, the more athletes does a country send to the games, the more medals it usually brings back home.</p>
				<p>The medal distribution is quite uneven. Most of the countries do not win any medals.
Then there is a healthy middle, and a few notable countries who get most of the medals: the USA, China, Russia and the UK.</p>
				<p>When visualising countries we have found, that most of them fall on the same line with
the increasing wellbeing towards one end, but there are certain ones of them that fall outside of this continuum, usually aforementioned
four together with India, Brazil, Canada and a few others. That would mean that these countries have certain characteristics that are
disproportionate to others, which we think are related to their size.</p>
				<p>From the visualisation of the medical situation in the world, we can once again conclude, that most
of the Africa is still at the lower end of spectrum, while the bright side of it is preoccupied predominantly by Western European countries,
and some others that we would consider a part of developed world, like the USA, Japan or New Zealand.</p>

			<h1>Medal Predictors</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>We did not do enough research to firmly establish, which fields would be the most useful
in predicting the medal count. However we can definitely spot some correlations.</p>
				<p>The team size correlates with the medal count extremely well, which is only natural, since
it is difficult (though possible) to win more medals than the number of athletes you have sent. And some countries won more medals,
than the size of a few delegations of smaller countries put together.</p>
				<p>Number of various medical personel was also highly correlated, since it shows the general development
of the country.</p>
				<p>Tax revenue, capital formation and the country size are another predictors, however the later one might be biased by a few
extremely large countries winning a lot of medals.</p>
				<p>The last group of correlated columns, and the biggest one of them, is the most controversial: all sorts of cancer-related
data appears to be inline with the medals. It might be yet another indicator of the developed country, though, since such countries usually have worse environmental
conditions than rural states, as well as greater lifespan, increasing the likelyhood of bad mutations.</p>
			</div>
		</article>
		<article id="recommendations" class="subwindow">
			<h1>Recommendations</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>In order to win more medals, it pays to be a well-developed country with a stable financial situation.
It comes to no surprise, however this is the most prominent trend. The notable exception is Russia, which is less developed than say Germany,
yet still brings much more medals; nonetheless we can speculate that this is a matter of pride for the country, and the country thus probably spends
larger precentage of its GDP on training its team, countering the issue with the generally poorer economic situation. This theory get additional support
from the fact, that GDP does correlate with medals better than GDP per capita, which is counterintuitive at the beginning.</p>
				<p>It seems that having a more developed medical system also helps, since the countries with the greater
concentration of medical personel were performing better. Which is yet another indication of being better developed.</p>
				<p>In short, the countries should spend more on sports and improve the healthcare situation. They should also probably
aim to increase a lifespan, which we speculate from the cancer correlation to medals. Even if that does not give you more medals, you will end up
with a better place to live, so this is a win-win situation.</p>
